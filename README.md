# diabetes-classification-assignment
This repository contains the third Deep Learning assignment, focused on classifying patients using the Diabetes dataset. The classification was based on custom labels created by dividing Y, the measure of disease progression one year after baseline, into:

1. Percentiles
   
2. Deciles
   
The assignment explores how these different labeling strategies impact classification model performance.
